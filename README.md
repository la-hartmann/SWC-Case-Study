This was a case study conducted through Springboard's Data Analytics program - the purpose of the study was to use both descriptive and inferential statistics to 
predict pump failure of Southern Water Corp's water pump assets based on performance data collected before, during, and after pump failure. 

The original analysis was completed in Excel, then followed up in the Jupyter notebook here using Python.
